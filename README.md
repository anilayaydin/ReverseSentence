# ReverseSentence

Create an algorithm that reverses each word in a sentence. The input to the function will be a string and the output will be a new string where each word is reversed. There will be no punctuation and each word will be separated by spaces. Casing should remain the same. If a given letter was uppercase, it should remain uppercase in the reversal.
